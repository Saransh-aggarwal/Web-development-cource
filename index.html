                        As Adani's stocks continued to bleed, Adani Group came out with another media statement. This

                        its
                        legal head Jatin Jalundhwala mentioned in the statement that "the maliciously mischievous,
                        unresearched
                        report published by Hindenburg Research has adversely affected the Adani Group, our shareholders
                        and
                        investors. The volatility in Indian stock markets created by the report is of great concern and
                        has
                        led
                        to unwanted anguish for Indian citizens."

                        with opening subscriptions for its follow-on public offering (FPO) of $2.5 billion, despite a
                        continued
                        stock sell-off seen in group companies’ stocks. The FPO gets launched amid a rapid sell-off in
                        Adani
                        portfolio companies' shares. The offer received a muted response and was subscribed to only 0.01
                        times
                        on Day 1.

                        Adani stocks continue to bleed even more heavily in double digits, with Adani Enterprises down
                        18%
                        on
                        that day, Adani Green Energy down 19%, Adani Ports down 16%, and Adani Transmission down 19% vs.
                        their
                        closing prices a day before.

                        In a statement, he said it would “not be morally correct” to go ahead with the FPO in light of
